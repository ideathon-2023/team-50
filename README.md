# Idea:
- An app/game which is a collection of classic card games, famous(like bluff) and unknown(tbd which ones exaclty)
- Make it  multiplayer publicly and private, with major focus being on replacing a card deck in a room(private multiplayer)
  {with options of the main deck on screen or on a commonly visible device, etc.)
